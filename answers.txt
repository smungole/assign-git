•  What does fast-forward in git mean?
   Answer: Fast-forward merges literally move your main branch's tip forward to 
   the end of your feature branch.

   Answer: Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code 
   base and isolate their work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge 
   versions later on.

•  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

   repositories handling different aspects of development e.g. repository for 
   backend development, 1 for web development, and either 1 or 2 for mobile 
   development depending on the type of framework the orgranization is using.
